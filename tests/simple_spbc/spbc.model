%% Simple sticky-price business-cycle model
%
% This is a model source fille for a simple sticky-price business model.
% The model file describes variables, parameters and equations. Note that
% the model file does not specifies the tasks that will be performed with
% the model. The tasks will be set up in separate m-files, using standard
% Matlab functions and IrisT functions.
%
% Model source files themselves cannot be executed. Instead, they are read
% in and converted into model objects by the Iris function
% `Model.fromFile()`. This is shown in [`createModel`](createModel.m).
%


%% Declare variables, shocks, parameters
%
% Use single-quoted text preceding the respective name to annotate the
% variablews, shocks, or parameters. These descriptions are stored in the
% resulting model object as well.

%% Control linearized and log-linerised variables
%
% By default, all variables are linearized when the first-order solution is
% computed in non-linear models. If you want some variables to be
% log-linearized instead, use the `!log-variables` section. Note how the
% keyword `!all-but` reverses the logic of this section -- all variables
% will be log-linearized except those listed here.

%% Write model equations
%
% Each equation must end with a semicolon. As in variable declaration,
% equations also can be annotated with a single-quoted text preceding the
% equation.
