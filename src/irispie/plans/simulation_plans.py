Simulation meta plans
======================

`SimulationPlan` objects are used to set up meta information about
conditioning assumptions for simulations of
[`Simultaneous`](simultaneous_modelsd) or [`Sequential`](sequential_models)
models. The simulation plans specify

* what variables to exogenize in what periods
* what shocks to endogenized in what periods (`Simultaneous` models only)
* what anticipation status to assign (`Simultaneous` models only)

The plans only contain meta information, not the actual data points for the
exogenized variables. The actual data points are expected to be included in
the input databox when the simulation is run.

==Exogenize certain LHS quantities at certain dates==

Exogenize certain LHS quantities at specified dates, setting them as
predetermined values within the simulation of
a [`Sequential` model](sequential.md). This method is used to control how
the model behaves during simulations by fixing certain variables to known
values.

### Input arguments ###

???+ input "self"
    The simulation plan in which data points will be exogenized.

???+ input "dates"
    A list of dates or `...` to apply to all dates at which the quantities 
    will be exogenized.

???+ input "names"
    A list of names or a single name, or `...` to apply to all names that 
    specifies which quantities to set as predetermined at the specified dates.

???+ input "transform"
    Specifies the transformation to apply to the exogenized quantities. If not
    specified, no transformation is applied. Available transformations include:

    * `None`: Exogenize the LHS variables as they are with no
    transformation.

    * `"log"`: Exogenize the natural logarithm of the LHS variables. Input
    time series needs to be prefixed with `log_`.

    * `"diff"`: Exogenize the first difference of the LHS variables. Input
    time series needs to be prefixed with `diff_`.

    * `"diff_log"`: Exogenize the first difference of the natural logarithm
    of the LHS variables. Input time series needs to be prefixed with
    `diff_log_`.

    * `"roc"`: The gross rate of change of the LHS variables from one
    period to the next. Input time series needs to be prefixed with `roc_`.

    * `"pct"`: The percentage change of the LHS variables from one period

???+ input "when_data"

    value exists in the input data.
