Databoxes
==========

`Databoxes` extend the standard `dict` class (technically, they are a
subclass), serving as a universal tool for storing and manipulating
unstructured data organized as key-value pairs. The values stored within
`Databoxes` can be of any type.

`Databoxes` can use any methods implemented for the standard `dict`
objects, and have additional functionalities for data item manipulation,
batch processing, importing and exporting data, and more.

### Input arguments ###


???+ input "func"
    The function to apply to each selected item in the Databox.

???+ input "source_names"
    Names of the items to which the function will be applied. Can be a list of 
    names, a single name, a callable returning `True’ for names to include, or 
    `None` to apply to all items.

???+ input "in_place"
    Determines if the results of the function should be assigned back to the 
    items in-place. If `True`, items are updated in-place; if `False`, the
    results are reassigned to the items.

???+ input "when_fails"
    Specifies the action to take if applying the function fails. Options are 
    "critical", "error", "warning", or "silent".

???+ input "strict_names"
    If set to `True`, strictly adheres to the provided names, raising an error 
    if any source name is not found in the Databox.

    argument only applies to the Databox items, and not the Databox itself)
