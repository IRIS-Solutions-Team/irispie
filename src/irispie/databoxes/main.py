Databoxes
==========

`Databoxes` extend the standard `dict` class (technically, they are a
subclass), serving as a universal tool for storing and manipulating
unstructured data organized as key-value pairs. The values stored within
`Databoxes` can be of any type.

`Databoxes` can use any methods implemented for the standard `dict`
objects, and have additional functionalities for data item manipulation,
batch processing, importing and exporting data, and more.
