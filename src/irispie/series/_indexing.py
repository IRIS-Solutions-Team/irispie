Time `Series` objects can be indexed in four ways (note the square versus round
brackets):

| Indexing                                           | Description
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------
| `self[shift]`                                      | Time shift
| `self[dates]`, `self[dates, variants]`             | Data extraction
| `self[dates] = ...`, `self[dates, variants] = ...` | Data assignment
| `self(dates)`, `self(dates, variants)`             | Time `Series` recreation


### Time shift ###

```
self[shift]
```

Time shift is done by passing an integer to the `self[shift]` or
`self[shift]` indexing. The time shift syntax returns a new copy of the
original series, with the time periods shifted by `shift`.


### Data extractation ###

```
self[dates]
self[dates, variants]
```

The `dates` is a `Dater` or a tuple of `Daters` or a time `Span` object,
and `variants` is an integer or a tuple of integers or a `slice` object
specifying the variants. The data extraction syntax returns a
two-dimensional `numpy` array, with the time dimension running along the
rows and the variant dimension running along the columns.


### Data assignment ###

```
self[dates] = ...
self[dates, variants] = ...
```

The `dates` is a `Dater` or a tuple of `Daters` or a time `Span` object,
and `variants` is an integer or a tuple of integers or a `slice` object
specifying the variants. The data assignment syntax sets the data in the
time series.


### Time `Series` recreation ###

```
self(dates)
self(dates, variants)
```

The `dates` is a `Dater` or a tuple of `Daters` or a time `Span` object,
and `variants` is an integer or a tuple of integers or a `slice` object
specifying the variants. The time `Series` recreation syntax returns a new
time `Series` object based on the data selected by the `dates` and
`variants`.
