### Input arguments ###


???+ input "target_freq"
    The new frequency to which the original time series will be diaggregated.

???+ input "method"
    Aggregation method, i.e. a function applied to the high-frequency
    values within each low-frequency period:

    | Method    | Description
    |-----------|-------------
    | "mean"    | Arithmetic average of high-frequency values
    | "sum"     | Sum of high-frequency values
    | "first"   | Value in the first high-frequency period
    | "last"    | Value in the last high-frequency period
    | "min"     | Minimum of high-frequency values
    | "max"     | Maximum of high-frequency values

???+ input "remove_missing"
    Remove missing values from the high-frequency data before
    applying the aggregation `method`.

???+ input "select"
    Select only the high-frequency values at the specified indexes;
    `select=None` means all values are used.


### Returns ###

???+ returns "self"
    The original time `Series` object with the aggregated data.

???+ returns "new"
    A new time `Series` object with the aggregated data.

    | "arip"    | Interpolate using a smooth autoregressive process


### Returns ###


???+ returns "new"
    A new time `Series` object with the disaggregated data.



### Details ###

???+ details "ARIP algorithm"

    The `method="arip" setting invokes an interpolation method that assumes the
    underlying high-frequency process to be an autoregression. The method can be
    described in its state-space recursive form, although the numerical
    implementation is stacked-time.

    The `"rate"` model:

    $$
    \begin{gathered}
    x_t = \rho \, x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\[10pt]
    y_t = Z \, x_t \\[10pt]
    \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma_t^2)
    \end{gathered}
    $$

    The `"diff"` model:

    $$
    \begin{gathered}
    x_t = x_{t-1} + c + \epsilon_t \\[10pt]
    y_t = Z \, x_t \\[10pt]
    \epsilon_t \sim N(0, 1)
    \end{gathered}
    $$

    where

    * $x_t$ is the underlying high-frequency process;

    * $y_t$ is the observed low-frequency time series;

    * $Z$ is an aggregation vector depending on the `aggregation` specification,

    | Aggregation | $Z$ vector
    |-------------|-----------
    | "sum"       | $(1, 1, \ldots, 1)$
    | "mean"      | $\tfrac{1}{n}\,(1, 1, \ldots, 1)$
    | "first"     | $(1, 0, \ldots, 0)$
    | "last"      | $(0, 0, \ldots, 1)$

    * $\rho$ is a gross rate of change estimated as the average rate of change
    in the observed series, $y_t$, and converted to high frequency;

    * $c$ is a constant estimated as the average difference in the observed
    series, $y_t$, and converted to high frequency;

    * $\sigma_t$ is a time-varying standard deviation of the high-frequency process, set to $\sigma_0 = 1$, and $\sigma_t = \rho \, \sigma_{t-1}$.
